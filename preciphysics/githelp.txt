##### REMINDER FOR GIT COMMANDS #####

##### TO UP TO DATE YOUR FORK #####
#git remote add upstream https://github.com/donmezk/visjobs.git
1- git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/donmezk/visjobs.git
2- git remote set-url origin https://github.com/donmezberkay/visjobs.git
#For example Now I started Fork Up to Date Process for visjobs
#I need to put owner's clone link following 'upstream' above
#But I need to put my own Fork clone link following 'origin' above
#step 1 and 2 not obligatory each time when you up to date your fork
# whenever you set upstream and origin it will stay as it is
2- git fetch upstream
3- git merge upstream/master master
